\section{Deliverables}

\begin{itemize}
	\item A public GitHub repository with the benchmark model code and instructions for use.
	\item A document providing the implementation-independent definition of the binned benchmark template that are representative of particle physics use cases.
	\item Scripts preparing the benchmarks using \code{HistFactory} to establish the \code{RooFit} benchmark.
	\item A technical report investigating the potential and limits of data flow graph frameworks for particle physics statistical models.
	\item A tutorial on data flow graphs targeted for physicists.
	\item Contributions to a probabilistic framework (if time permits).
\end{itemize}
